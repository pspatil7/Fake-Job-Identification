Todayâ€™s job search candidates utilize many online job boards to search jobs and it is both wasteful of time and potentially dangerous if they apply for a job posting that is fake.They can unknowingly give up personal information or other potential security concerns by responding to fake job postings!

In this project I have tried to tackle this problem by training and evaluating the performance of several machine learning models to identify these fake job postings.
For this project, I chose to train and evaluate the following machine learning models: 
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree Classifier
3) Random Forest Classifier
4) K Nearest Neighbors Classifier 
5) Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
6) Gradient Boosting
